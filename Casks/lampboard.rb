# Cask template for marmyx77/homebrew-tap (Casks/lampboard.rb).
#
# Rendered by `Scripts/make-cask.sh` from a published release: 0.4.3 and
# 495042e140e682a5f929e3e411727fba840d89570df1f9c92afb93cdaaa32685 are the tag and the disk image's checksum. Two placeholders and
# `sed`, not `envsubst` — gettext is not on a clean Mac, and a release script
# that fails on the machine cutting the release is worse than one extra sed.
#
# One artifact installs the whole product. The app is the panel and the server;
# the same executable is the CLI, and the `binary` stanza puts it on PATH.
# Measured before choosing it: `lampboard status` behaves identically run
# through a symlink outside the bundle and run inside it.

  # Opened on install. LampBoard has no Dock icon and its panel is the whole
  # interface: a fresh install that launches nothing is a fresh install that
  # looks like it failed, and the caveats have already scrolled past by then.
  # Homebrew quarantines every cask and, since Homebrew 6, `--no-quarantine` is
  # gone. So the first launch raises the system's "downloaded from the Internet"
  # dialog — and this launch happens while the person is reading the terminal,
  # not watching the screen. Measured: the dialog waits, the panel never starts,
  # the server never binds, and every `lampboard` command hangs with no timeout
  # against a port nobody is listening on. Nothing on screen explains it.
  #
  # The caveats say so, because the alternative is an install that looks broken.

  # `brew uninstall --zap lampboard` is the full teardown. What it deliberately
  # does **not** touch is `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/hooks.json`:
  # those are the user's files, shared with everything else they have installed,
  # and a package manager editing them on the way out is a package manager that
  # will one day delete somebody else's hook. `lampboard uninstall-hooks`
  # removes ours, by exact path, and it is named in the caveats.

  caveats <<~EOS
    LampBoard is opening now: the panel appears in the corner of the screen.
    It has no Dock icon and no menu bar item — the panel is the interface.

    macOS asks once, because Homebrew marks every download: a dialog saying
    LampBoard was downloaded from the Internet. Click Open. Until you do, the
    panel does not start and every `lampboard` command waits for a server that
    is not listening yet.

    To register the hooks that feed it:

      lampboard install-hooks

    That wires Claude Code, and Codex too if you have it. Codex then needs one
    thing nobody can do for you: open Codex, run /hooks, and approve the entry.
    Until you do, Codex reports nothing and says nothing about why.

    To remove the hooks later:  lampboard uninstall-hooks
  EOS
