# Cask template for marmyx77/homebrew-tap (Casks/lampboard.rb).
#
# Rendered by `Scripts/make-cask.sh` from a published release: 0.2.2 and
# 0d4efd51badd2804450df6c8e262b67f0382eed5be36ed985e8515be1a35b760 are the tag and the disk image's checksum. Two placeholders and
# `sed`, not `envsubst` — gettext is not on a clean Mac, and a release script
# that fails on the machine cutting the release is worse than one extra sed.
#
# One artifact installs the whole product. The app is the panel and the server;
# the same executable is the CLI, and the `binary` stanza puts it on PATH.
# Measured before choosing it: `lampboard status` behaves identically run
# through a symlink outside the bundle and run inside it.

  # `brew uninstall --zap lampboard` is the full teardown. What it deliberately

  # those are the user's files, shared with everything else they have installed,
  # and a package manager editing them on the way out is a package manager that
  # will one day delete somebody else's hook. `lampboard uninstall-hooks`
  # removes ours, by exact path, and it is named in the caveats.

  caveats <<~EOS
    LampBoard is opening now: the panel appears in the corner of the screen.
    It has no Dock icon and no menu bar item — the panel is the interface.

    To register the hooks that feed it:

      lampboard install-hooks

    That wires Claude Code, and Codex too if you have it. Codex then needs one
    thing nobody can do for you: open Codex, run /hooks, and approve the entry.
    Until you do, Codex reports nothing and says nothing about why.

    To remove the hooks later:  lampboard uninstall-hooks
